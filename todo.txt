    Set up the project:
        Create a new Python project directory. ✅
        Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.✅

    Define the chessboard:
        Create a data structure to represent the chessboard (e.g., a 2D array, matrix, or nested lists).✅
        Initialize the chessboard with the starting position.✅

    Display the chessboard:
        Implement a function to print the chessboard to the console.✅
        Use Unicode characters or ASCII art to represent the chess pieces.✅

    Implement chess piece movement:
        Create classes for each chess piece type (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king).
        Define methods for validating and executing legal moves for each piece.
        Implement functions to handle capturing pieces and en passant.

    Handle player input:
        Create a function to parse user input for moves (e.g., algebraic notation).
        Validate the input for correctness and legality.

    Implement game logic:
        Define a game loop that alternates between players' turns.
        Prompt the current player for a move and execute it.
        Check for checkmate, stalemate, and other game-ending conditions.
        Allow players to offer and accept draws.

    Add additional features:
        Implement castling, pawn promotion, and en passant capture.
        Add support for move history and the ability to undo moves.
        Implement a basic AI opponent using algorithms like minimax or alpha-beta pruning.

    Test the game:
        Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the game's logic.
        Manually play the game and ensure all rules are followed.

    Polish the user interface:
        Improve the console display with formatting and color.
        Add prompts, error messages, and instructions for the players.

    Optional: Create a graphical user interface (GUI):
        Use a library like Pygame or Tkinter to create a visual chessboard.
        Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving pieces.
