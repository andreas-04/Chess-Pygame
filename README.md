# Chess-Pygame
Chess built in pygame

# ToDo 
    Set up the project:
        Create a new Python project directory. ✅

    Define the chessboard:
        Create a data structure to represent the chessboard ✅
        Initialize the chessboard with the starting position.✅

    Display the chessboard:
        Implement a function to print the chessboard to the console.✅
        Use Unicode characters or ASCII art to represent the chess pieces.✅❌

    Implement chess piece movement:
        Create classes for each chess piece type (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king).✅
        Define methods for validating and executing legal moves for each piece. ✅
        Implement functions to handle capturing pieces and en passant.⌛️✅

    Implement game logic:
        Define a game loop that alternates between players' turns.✅
        Prompt the current player for a move and execute it.✅
        Check for checkmate, stalemate, and other game-ending conditions.⏳
        Allow players to offer and accept draws.

    Add additional features:
        Implement castling, pawn promotion, and en passant capture.
        Add support for move history and the ability to undo moves.
        Implement a basic AI opponent using algorithms like minimax
